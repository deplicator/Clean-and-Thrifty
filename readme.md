###Page Templates
####News
The news page template is intended to be a blank page that displays post in the 'News' category.
This makes for an ideal front page to display important information.

###Images
This theme contains minor changes to the official BSA images. All the changes are documented here.

* [Boy Scout Universal Emblem Trademark](http://www.scouting.org/filestore/marketing/Brand/BSA_Black.jpg)
    * Replaced white background with transparent.
    * Saved as PNG.

* [BSA Stationery Action Folio](http://www.scouting.org/filestore/marketing/images/ActionFolio_blue.png)
    * Minor image modification so it can loop.

###Credits

[Sticky Footer Code](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/using-sticky-footer-code.html)


To Do
-----
* Link to home in header/title
* Update single, category, comments, and other neglected php files.
* CSS for inside post entries and comment sections.
* Changeable logo and colors (ie for cub scouts, venture, etc...)
* Footer info options (like meeting time and place and contact info)
* Less minor changes to footer image, do something with the end of that rope that's just kind of out there.
